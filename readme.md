## Building the UI

You can use these commands to build the User Interface:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Adding Regions

Not all regions are available to everyone. I have added the regions that are generally available to all,
and some kind individuals have set up additional regions that they have access to.

The cost should be negligible, and if you change your mind at any time and want to remove the region, that's ok - just let me know.

To add a region, follow this process:

1. Create a storage account, preferably with a name like `speedtestxyz`, where the 'xyz' is an abbreviation of your region name. The storage account can be a standard, locally redundant account (the cheapest kind).
1. Create a `$root` container in blob storage, allowing public blobs (blob listing is not necessary).
1. Add a file called `cb.json`, which contains a single line `call("speedtestxyz")`, where 'speedtestxyz' is the name of your storage account.
1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Edit the `lib/locations.js` file to add a record for your new region (using the correct flag from this [repo](https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags/tree/master/svg)).
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run the site locally (I use [node-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-static)) to test that the site works.
1. Create a pull request.

If you're only able to help with steps 1..3 it would be hugely helpful, I can do the remaining steps.

Thank you!
